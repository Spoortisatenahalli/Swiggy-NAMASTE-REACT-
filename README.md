# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

//Named Export will be imported with curly brackets


Defualt export

export default component;
import component from "path"

Named Component

export const component
import {component} from "path

Whenever the State Variable updates React rerenders the component

Reconcialiation Algorithum- > React Fibre WHere our DOm renders based on State rendering.
Virtual DOm is a representation of Actual Dom

Diff Algotithum -> Will find out the difference between 2 dom Virtual and real DOm

Useeffect will be called after the component has been rendered


Monolithic- Is Something where Backend Frontend and all other services are deployed under one roof

Microservice- > Follows Single responsiblity principle , Where each and every component in built in one one saperate microservive


Whenever the state variable updates react renders the component(react triggers a reconsilation)

UseEffect with empyty dependency will be called only once the component is rendered.
UseEffect with its dependency value will update the component only when the dependency variable gets changed / it will render the compoennegt


Client side Routing
Server Side Routing

We will be using Client side Routing bcz there will be no API call happening , all the components will be loaded once app renderderd here we are only making redirection


Style components
Material UI
Bootstrap
Chakra
css/sass
